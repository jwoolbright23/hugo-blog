## About Me

My name is John Woolbright and I am a Technical Curriculum Developer at LaunchCode. I have worked for LaunchCode since August 12th 
of 2019 which is when my career in tech began. 

My journey with LaunchCode started as a Candidate Engagement Manager where my main responsibilities included program delivery and program management.

I spent close to 1.5 years in time as a CEM before I transitioned into a Senior CEM role that included similar responsibilties in addition to managing internal staff.

After spending another year in a the senior CEM position I applied and happily accepted the role of Technical Curriculum Developer which is where my larger interests lie.

I am currently working very closely with Linux systems and am excited to share some of my work and projects on this platform.
