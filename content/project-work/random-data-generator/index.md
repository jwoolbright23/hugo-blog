## Description

During the development of the Linux curriculum we created a random data generator for testing purposes. The reason we did this was to work with tools like grep, sed, curl, and wget. The generator will provide four separate CSV files with over 25,000 records in each. 

We did generate some files that we were able to deterministically know the outcomes of some commands to write effective exercises and walkthroughs. There is also another option to generate a new random dataset in the scenario a student would like to work with a new set of CSVs to run commands on.
