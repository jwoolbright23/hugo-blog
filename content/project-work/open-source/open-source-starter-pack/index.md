## Description

Learners that graduate from our programs are often encouraged to contribute to open source projects so further develop their professional experience and skills. 

We thought that it may be helpful if a walkthrough was provided that gives a better idea of what that general workflow is in order to contribute to an existing project.

Steps included in walkthrough:
1. `Forking an existing repository`
1. `File structure explanation`
1. `Cloning forked repository`
1. `Creating a new branch`
1. `Making changes and staging`
1. `Push local changes to forked remote repo`
1. `Submitting pull request`
