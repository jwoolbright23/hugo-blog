## Description

Since EC2 instances is the resource used for learners with the M1 ARM chip I decided to jump into aws infrastructure first. My goal is to follow the steps in the tutorial but ultimately do the following:

1. Learn IaC with Terraform
1. Seemlessly create new EC2 instances for future classes with the golden image already created
1. Have fun
